The Abbreviated Language For Authorization (ALFA) is often used to express access control policies in systems that use Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). Translating a policy like the one youâ€™ve provided involves defining permission rules, attributes, and conditions based on the regulatory requirements outlined in the policy. Below is an attempt to describe the policy using ALFA-like syntax:

```alfa
policy RemoteAccessPolicy {
    /**
     * Defines the policy to regulate remote access to department information systems.
     *
     * Conditions for remote access:
     * 1. Remote access systems must be Government or contractor-owned.
     * 2. Remote access from personally owned or public computers is prohibited.
     * 3. Security requirements for remote computers include:
     *    - Anti-viral software
     *    - FIPS 140-2 validated or NSA-approved encryption
     *    - Current OS and application security updates
     *    - Configuration management ensuring compliance
     *    - Two-factor authentication
     *    - VPN encryption
     *    - Single operating system and network interface card during session
     */

    // User attributes
    attribute userDeviceType {
        type: string
        issuer: "DeviceOwnership"
        description: "Type of device ownership"
    }

    attribute userDeviceCompliant {
        type: boolean
        issuer: "SecuritySoftwareCompliance"
        description: "Is the user device compliant with security software requirements"
    }

    attribute userEncryptedVPN {
        type: boolean
        issuer: "VPNCompliance"
        description: "Is the user accessing via an encrypted VPN"
    }

    attribute userTwoFactorAuth {
        type: boolean
        issuer: "AuthenticationCompliance"
        description: "Is two-factor authentication being used"
    }

    attribute userNetworkConnection {
        type: boolean
        issuer: "NetworkConnectionStatus"
        description: "Is the user connected solely to Department IT system"
    }

    // Permit rule
    rule PermitRemoteAccess if {
        userDeviceType == "Government" || userDeviceType == "Contractor"
        and userDeviceCompliant == true
        and userEncryptedVPN == true
        and userTwoFactorAuth == true
        and userNetworkConnection == true
    }

    // Prohibition rules
    rule DenyAccess if {
        userDeviceType == "Personal" || userDeviceType == "Public"
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- The **userDeviceType** attribute checks whether the remote computer is government-owned or contractor-owned.
- The **userDeviceCompliant** attribute ensures that the remote computer meets security requirements like having antivirus software and being fully patched.
- The **userEncryptedVPN** and **userTwoFactorAuth** attributes ensure compliance with VPN encryption and two-factor authentication respectively.
- The **userNetworkConnection** attribute ensures the computer is only connected to the Department's IT system and not other networks.
- The **PermitRemoteAccess** rule grants access only to compliant and verified devices.
- The **DenyAccess** rule explicitly denies access to personal or public devices, aligning with the policy.

This simplified ALFA-like representation is hypothetical and intended to capture the intent of the original policy. Actual implementations may vary based on the specific ABAC system in use.
