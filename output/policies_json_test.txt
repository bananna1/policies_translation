Remote access presents additional security concerns since the Component has no direct control over the application of required security controls or the assessment of security control effectiveness of the connecting network","body":"The goal of this policy is to ensure Components can safely utilize remote access to better accomplish their missions. Remote access systems shall be restricted to Government owned or contractor owned systems. Remote access from personally owned or “public computers” is prohibited.

(2) Remote computers shall have all current and applicable Operating System (OS) and application security updates in place.  (3) Components shall utilize a configuration management system for remote access computers to ensure the remote access computer has the Component approved security software in place, the OS is fully patched, antivirus software is installed and up-to-date and a personal firewall is enabled.  (4) Remote access computers shall use two-factor authentication where one factor is provided by a device separate from the computer gaining access.  (5) Remote access computers shall use an encrypted VPN to connect to Department information systems.  (6) Remote access computers shall not be connected to any other network when connected to a Department IT system.
